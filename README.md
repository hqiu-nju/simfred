# simfred
An FRB simulation repo for multiple purposes. Originally designed to simulated data to test FREDDA, hence simfred

### Dynspec Package
The simulation models are setup in dynspec.py, please link fbio.py and dynspec.py to PYTHONPATH in your .bashrc or .bash_profile.

An example to mass generate FRBs is shown in pifa.py. Pifa is from the word 批发, which means bulk buying....

An example to use the models to fit FRB pulse profiles is in dynspec example.ipynb
