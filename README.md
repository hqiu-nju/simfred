# simfred
An FRB simulation repo for multiple purposes. Originally designed to simulated data to test FREDDA, hence simfred

### Dynspec Package
The simulation models are setup in dynspec.py, please link fbio.py and dynspec.py to PYTHONPATH in your .bashrc or .bash_profile.

A basic example to mass generate FRBs is shown in pifa.py. Pifa is from the word 批发, which means bulk buying....

Latest example script to Qiu et al. 2023 is simscript_2023.py

An example to use the models to fit FRB pulse profiles is in dynspec example.ipynb
